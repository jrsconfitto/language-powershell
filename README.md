# PowerShell language support in Atom [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jugglingnutcase/language-powershell.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jugglingnutcase/language-powershell)

This package provides [PowerShell](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/mt173057.aspx) language support in the [Atom editor](https://atom.io) by leveraging the [PowerShell syntax][ES] from Microsoft.

## Issues

If you discover any issues with the way the syntax is highlighted, please open an issue against the [PowerShell/EditorSyntax][ES] repository instead of this one, since this package is based on that grammar.

Any issues that aren't related to the grammar are fair game here, though! Start one [here](https://github.com/jugglingnutcase/language-powershell/issues/new).
